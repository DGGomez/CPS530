React:

8/10

Pros
- Easy to configure and use
- Lots of help online
- Good for multipage web apps and websites

Cons: 
- Error messages don't give a lot of feed back on problem
- Not much documentation on redux

Comment:

React was a good framework for building our multipage website. It was very easy to install
and with basic tutorials you can make quick websites. The problems started when introducing
redux and action listeners as there isn't a great deal of information about them as well there 
are several different ways of performing those actions. Overall though it is
a great tool for quick multipage apps and web apps.

Ruby on rails:

9/10

pros:
- Does a lot of the set up work for you
- Everything is already organized when you create the project
- Not alot of work to get a fully functional API

cons:
- Getting use to rails format takes a while as the initial project created is very large

Comment:

Ruby on rails initially is a lot to take in. When you first create your first rails app
it comes with a large amount of files that need some time to decifer. After the initial 
confusion though it is clear that each file speeds up configuration for your app. As 
well the rails api does a lot of the work for you. Building an API with rails was easy and
fast.
